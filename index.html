      <h2>My PC Build and Why It Still Works for Me</h2>

    <p>
      I built this rig back in August of 2022. The original parts were a Ryzen 9 5900X, an EVGA GTX 1080, and 32 GB of RAM.
      I wanted a PC that could handle school work, light editing, and games without sounding like a jet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 5900X gave me strong multithreaded performance, and the 1080 was good enough 
      for 1080p and some 1440p titles with settings tuned.
      I used Lian Li connectable fans so I could keep cables tidy and still get solid airflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      That small decision made building easier and the inside of the case cleaner.
      It also made later changes simple because I did not have to fight a spaghetti of fan cables.
      Since then I have only made one major change: 
    </p>
    <p>
      I upgraded the GPU to a 4070.
      Everything else stayed the same because it still meets my needs.
      The CPU still does great with games and background tasks. 
      The memory is enough for my browser, IDE, and a game at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 4070 pushed frame rates up and added DLSS support, which is nice for newer games.
      I like the balance right now: good performance, good thermals.
      If I change anything next, it would probably be the storage.
    </p>

      <h2>Lions vs. Ravens: Roaring Win on Monday Night</h2>

    </figure>

    <p>
      The Lions showed up and got a 38–30 win over the Ravens on Monday Night Football. The offense
      kept the pressure on all game, and the defense did just enough in
      the key spots to hold on to the lead. The best part was how steady and easy the drives looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even when the Ravens tried to flip momentum, the response was calm play calls and clean execution. 
      Third downs were the difference. Convert those and you control tempo, keep the 
      defense rested, and squeeze the clock late.
    </p>
    <p>
      The box score tells one story, but watching told another: the team looked confident.
      That confidence showed up in protection, in yards after catch,
      and in how they closed the fourth quarter. If they keep that same balance and efficiency,
    </p>
    <p>
      passing, a few big and explosive runs, and mistake free special teams, this is what will become
      the blueprint for Detroit's future.    </p>
    <p>
      It was not perfect, but it was the kind of win that makes Tuesday feel better in Detroit. 
      The next test will be consistency. Making sure to stay at this level of play
      matters more than a single primetime result.
